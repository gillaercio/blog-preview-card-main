## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Using Figma

### What I learned

I took advantage of this project to practice the use of variables in CSS, which standardize and facilitate project maintenance.

A code snippet below:

```css
:root {
  --yellow: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
  --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --gray-500: hsl(0, 0%, 42%);
  --gray-950: hsl(0, 0%, 7%);

  --font-family: 'Figtree', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
  --text-preset: bolder 2em/150% var(--font-family);
  --text-preset2: 1.6em/150% var(--font-family);
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to improve the use of **Flexbox** and further improve the dynamics of using **Figma**
